## üîë Hint & Write Up

* Try reading [Dojo-101](https://github.com/Aif4thah/Dojo-101), this project contains all you need to hack this app.
* [Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/Aif4thah?frequency=recurring&sponsor=Aif4thah) and get access to the **full methodology** and **complete write-up**.


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download

```PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/Aif4thah/VulnerableLightApp.git
cd .\VulnerableLightApp\
```


## üîßüî• Build and Run

You can use **Dotnet** or **Docker**

### Dotnet

Check `.csproj` file to get the current dotnet version and install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

```PowerShell
dotnet run [--url=<url>]
```

Alternatively, you can use bin files :

```PowerShell
dotnet build
.\bin\Debug\net8.0\VulnerableWebApplication.exe [--url=<url>]
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t vulnerablelightapp .
docker run -p 3000:3000 vulnerablelightapp 
```

### first request 

Default : `127.0.0.1:3000`

```sh
curl -k https://127.0.0.1:3000
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Debug 

### 401 Unauthorized 

Your first request may return a 401 code due to unsuccessful authentication. It's ok, Start Hacking !

### Dotnet Framework

Verify you use the intended .NET Framework

```cmd
where dotnet
dotnet --version
dotnet --list-sdks
```

### Dotnet on Linux 

Ubuntu / Debian exemple

```bash
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/12/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
apt update && apt install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0 dotnet-runtime-8.0
```


### Certificates

To trust the certificate

```PowerShell
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```


### Dependancies

dependancies have to be dowloaded from [standard sources](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054)

```sh
dotnet nuget add source "https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" --name "Microsoft"
```

### Misc

* Be aware that VLA runs Linux and MacOS, but is only tested and supported on Windows.
